        What is Desolation?
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-1">
        Desolation is an action RPG video game developed using RPG Maker VX Ace. The quickest way to describe it would
        be: A story heavily based on Diablo II, set in the world of Ragnarok Online with gameplay inspired by The Legend
        of Zelda: A Link to the Past. It may seem like a strange combination, but I've worked hard to connect the
        different sources of inspiration in a way that it makes sense - especially if you have played those games.
        Ultimately, this game is the culmination of my experience playing video games, I wanted to make something to
        honour some of the fantastic games that I've played throughout my life.

        A brief history:
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-2">
        Development began in 2014, at that time I did not know how to program and so I chose to use RPG Maker VX Ace, a
        game engine that provides a robust infrastructure to build games with no coding required. It started off as
        nothing serious and I just had the idea of recreating some Ragnarok Online maps, but the project kept growing as
        I became more and more fascinated with the game development process. My skills grew as I started using more
        advanced software to create maps and worked with custom scripts. Eventually the game grew into a massive project
        containing over 400 maps and 14+ hours of gameplay time. Due to a decrease in motivation I stopped development
        around 2019, but I do wish to revisit it to at least polish it enough to release it as a demo, and perhaps
        continue developing the rest of the game to release the final version.

        aria-controls="item-3">
        When will I be able to play it?
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-3">
        The game is currently incomplete, but I am planning on releasing a Demo version of the current game (around 14
        hours of playtime) once I flesh out some details (mainly story presentation). There's no current ETA but I would
        like to have the Demo ready for some time in 2022.

      <h5 class="about-heading" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#item-4" aria-expanded="false"
        aria-controls="item-4">
        When is the final version arriving?
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-4">
        Although I'm striving to release the work I've done so far as a demo (14+ hours of content), it is yet unclear
        if I'll carry on further development past that point. This is a fan-made project, one which I'll not profit
        from, and as such it remains a hobby project which I only
        work on during some of my free time.

        Why use RPG Maker?
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-5">
        RPG Maker 2003 was my first experience creating a game, it provides a robust infrastructure for you to be able
        to immediately get creative and make a turn-based RPG game without having to write code. It is fairly easy to
        get going, once you get the hang of Switches (boolean logic) and variables the possibilities are endless. It
        also allows you to create and edit scripts (written in RGSS, a scripting language based on Ruby) to customise
        your game.

    <div class="about-item">

        Design Philosophies:
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-6">
        First and foremost I wanted to create a game that I would enjoy playing. I wanted to make a game that gradually
        got more difficult and complex but never felt overwhelming. I wanted players to be able to beat the game at a
        reasonable difficulty without grinding for experience or gear, just defeating the monsters you come across
        should be enough. In terms of boss designs, I wanted a reasonable challenge so that most will require more than
        one attempt to beat. An RPG should reward exploration and observation, which is something I always had in mind
        when
        developing.
      </p>

        aria-controls="item-7">
        Why make a fan-game?
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-7">
        The project started with a simple idea: "what if I could recreate some Ragnarok Online maps?". I had no
        intentions of creating a massive project, I was just bored and wanted to mess around a bit. It's easy to work
        with a fan-game because you don't have to worry about creating something completely original, there's a
        framework you can use to base your project around, and for me I found it fun to reference a bunch of different
        games and have them connect somehow.
        If I had set out to create such a big project from the start, I would have chosen to make an original, but I am
        glad I developed this project as it provided me with valuable game design experience and tons of entertainment.

        What are the system requirements?
      </h5>
      <div class="about-content collapse" id="item-8">
        <p>It's difficult to measure the requirements for this game since I make use of a ton of custom scripts and
          assets,
          which the RPG Maker engine was not built for.
          <br>
          below are the specs of the machine I used to develop and test the game, where it runs fine:
        </p>
        <ul class="spec-list">
          <li>
            OS: Windows 10 (64-bit) / it should also work on Windows 7 and 8.
          </li>
          <li>
            Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4710MQ CPU @ 2.50GHz 2.50 GHz
          </li>
          <li>
            Graphics: Nvidia GeForce 840M
          </li>
          <li>
            Memory: 12 GB RAM / 8 GB RAM should be enough though
          </li>
          <li>
            Storage: At least 2 GB available space
          </li>
          <li>

        How about controller support?
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-9">
        The game supports USB Gamepads and allows the re-mapping of controls, I have tested it with a Wired Xbox 360
        controller and it works perfectly.

        How do I do/fix X?
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-10">
        The download file for the game will contain a Readme file, which will contain most information about the game,
        including: Controls, How to adjust settings, known issues and how to deal with them. I might add a way to report
        issues in the future, but there's no plans for it currently.

        What were your inspirations?
      </h5>
      <p class="about-content collapse" id="item-11">
        This game contains TONS of references to different games, movies and books. I took great pleasure in putting in
        references to my favourite pieces of media and weaving them together in a way that made sense. Here are some of
        the big ones: Diablo II, Ragnarok Online, The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy I & VII, Harry Potter, A Song of
        Ice and Fire, The Name of the Wind, H.P. Lovecraft.
